<h3>Setup and mobile version skeleton</h3>

This repository contains the code for setting up the mobile version of my portfolio website.

 <h3>Description</h3>
 
I'm a computer science student, and I've built this website to show off what I've been learning and working on. 
It's like a digital showcase of my skills and projects. I used HTML and CSS to create it. HTML helps organize the content,
while CSS makes it look cool and work well on different devices, like phones and computers.

 <h3>Features</h3>
 
- Navigation menu
- sections
- Social Medea links

 <h3>Language used</h3>
